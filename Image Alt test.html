                New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The city is the home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the City of New York what is known as the Statue of Liberty, which is currently located on Ellis Island commonly visited by tourists. However, it took 10 years to assemble and therefore wasn’t unveiled until 1886. Another tourist destination is Times Square. Times Square is commonly known for the big buildings, Broadway shows, and bright neon signs. This famous location was named after The New York Times after the Times moved to that location. Prior to that, it was named Longacre Square. New York City is also known for its bridges that connect the boroughs and allow ease of transportation.

<h2 id="testTrigger" dataf-uw-styling-context="true" >Intent</h2>
<p data-uw-styling-context="true" role="alert">The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide enough contrast between text and
    its background so that it can be read by people with moderately low vision (who do
    not use contrast-enhancing assistive technology). For people without color deficiencies,
    hue and saturation have minimal or no effect on legibility as assessed by reading
    performance (Knoblauch et al., 1991). Color deficiencies can affect luminance contrast
    somewhat. Therefore, in the recommendation, the contrast is calculated in such a way
    that color is not a key factor so that people who have a color vision deficit will
    also have adequate contrast between the text and the background.

<div class="note_class" id="note" data-uw-styling-context="true">
    <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3" data-uw-styling-context="true">Note</div>
    <div data-uw-styling-context="true">


        <p data-uw-styling-context="true">Images of text do not scale as well as text because they tend to pixelate. It is also
            harder to change foreground and background contrast and color combinations for images
            of text, which is necessary for some users. Therefore, we suggest using text wherever
            possible, and when not, consider supplying an image of higher resolution.
